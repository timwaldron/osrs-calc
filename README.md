Oldschool RuneScape Buddy
</h1>

<br>

## Project Outline

The Old School RuneScape Buddy was built as a terminal application in order to meet the requirements of the first assignment given at CoderAcademy.

The Buddy will be an interactive application that allows players of RuneScape to bring down their player data, make calculations and take notes.

### Instructions for use

1. Login with RuneScape username
2. Choose option
3. View skills / Calculate skill / Take notes
4. Return to menu screen
5. Choose a different option / Exit application
6. Enjoy playing RuneScape
7. Go outside

### Who It's For

Old School RuneScape skill calculator is for any individual that plays the game RuneScape. Simply enter your name and use the Buddy as a companion as you "Scape"

### How It Works

- outline of the technologies used
  Shows evidence of having considered accessibility.

### Usage

- here we will demonstrate application in use with a few screenshots

### Please note

three sentences how i have discussed the moral and ethical issues relating to use of the app<br>

A moral implication may arise when using the Buddy due to users wanting to reach their entered goals. Their health may be negatively impacted due to lack of physical activity.
For example if a user of the Buddy calculated they needed to fish 13004 to get to their desired Skill Level of 80 and proceeded not to leave their computer for 12 hours.

### Why we did what we did

## README explains the higher level structure of the app (e.g. why modules or functions were used or why separate files were utilized).<br>

README shows extensive evidence of thoughtful planning into the overall code structure within the app<br>

### Note to Future Developers

README shows outstanding evidence of how this project might be extended and worked upon by devs beyond this project

### How Everything Went

Any Problems?
did we change anything from intial goals?

Shows evidence of having attempted to meet the initial design specifications, or rationale as to why things changed during development.

## Line breaker ------------------------

separate files were used, not only to organise the code but also to enable seamless collaboration. While working in different files we found there was less conflicts to resolve and enable a more productive work.

During this project we ensured to make use of the webapp Trello, it was both of our first times using it. We found it smooth and seamless; improving both productivity and enjoyment.

Github was another technology utilised to manage workflow. Initially the process seemed clunky and unintuitive. After making something like 20 commits within the first hour we saw the value of the system and have used it extentively during this project.
