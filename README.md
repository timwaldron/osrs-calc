<h1>Oldschool RuneScape Skill Calculator</h1>
<br>
<h3>Project Outline</h3>
<br>

The Old School RuneScape skill calculator was built as a terminal application in order to meet the requirements of the first assignment given at CoderAcademy. 
Have you ever wondered how many trout you need to catch in order to get a 99? or how many goblins you need to slay to get 60 attack to wield your DDS? 
-
Well then the Oldschool RuneScape Skill Calculator is for YOU
<br>
This calculator will be an interactive tool that allows players of RuneScape to bring down their player data.
The application will then respond to user input and give calculations on chosen skills and  outline recommendations based on what the player can be doing in order to train that specific skill.
